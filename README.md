# Giphy Android Search Library

![preview1](artwork/preview.png) ![preview2](artwork/preview2.png)

This library is a wrapper Giphy's wonderful [API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI) and allows you to easily include animated GIFs in your projects.

The library will start by showing the trending GIFs then allow the user to search through Giphy's vast amount of animations.

GIFs are automatically played when the user scrolls through them, then, when the user clicks a GIF, it will be downloaded and the resulting `file://` URI will be returned to your `Activity`.

The library is extremely easy to implement, as shown below. Enjoy all the GIFs!

## Installation

In your project's root `build.gradle` (not your module's `build.gradle`):

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

To include it in your project, add this to your module's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
	...
	compile 'com.klinkerapps:giphy:2.1.1'
}
```

and resync the project.

## Usage

To create a giphy search activity, you can use `Giphy.Builder`:

```java
new Giphy.Builder(activity, "dc6zaTOxFJmzC")    // Giphy's BETA key
    .maxFileSize(5 * 1024 * 1024)               // 5 mb
    .start();
```

Max file size is optional. In your activity, listen for the results:

```java
@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    if (requestCode == Giphy.REQUEST_GIPHY) {
        if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
            Uri gif = data.getData();
            // do something with the uri.
        }
    } else {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    }
}
```

### Obtaining an API Key

Giphy makes a public BETA API key available for any one to use during testing: `dc6zaTOxFJmzC`.

They say that this BETA key is rate limited, so I recommend [applying](http://api.giphy.com/submit) for a production key.
